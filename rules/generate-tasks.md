1.  **Receive PRD Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific PRD file
2.  **Analyze PRD:** The AI reads and analyzes the functional requirements, user stories, and other sections of the specified PRD.
3.  **Assess Current State:** Review the existing codebase to understand existing infrastructre, architectural patterns and conventions. Also, identify any existing components or features that already exist and could be relevant to the PRD requirements. Then, identify existing related files, components, and utilities that can be leveraged or need modification.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the PRD analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 
5. **Inform the user:** Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet) For example, say "I have generated the high-level tasks based on the PRD. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed." . 
6.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
7.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the implementation details implied by the PRD, and consider existing codebase patterns where relevant without being constrained by them.
8.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and PRD, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
9.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
10.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory with the filename `tasks-[prd-file-name].md`, where `[prd-file-name]` matches the base name of the input PRD file (e.g., if the input was `prd-user-profile-editing.md`, the output is `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`).
